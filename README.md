# Reactive Students Spring Boot Basic Project

## Overview

This is a sample Spring Boot project that showcases the use of reactive programming to manage a student database. Reactive programming is an efficient way to handle concurrent and asynchronous operations, making it a great choice for applications with high I/O and event-driven requirements.

### Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for student records.
- Utilizes Spring WebFlux for reactive programming.
- Uses R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity) for reactive database interactions.

## Why Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming offers several advantages that make it well-suited for modern, high-performance applications like this student database project:

1. **Non-Blocking**: Reactive programming ensures non-blocking execution, allowing your application to handle a large number of concurrent requests without unnecessary resource consumption.

2. **Scalability**: It is highly scalable. Reactive applications can easily adapt to increased workloads by leveraging the responsiveness and efficiency of asynchronous operations.

3. **Efficiency**: The use of reactive streams and backpressure mechanisms ensures that resources are used efficiently, avoiding overloading of components.

4. **Responsiveness**: Reactive systems are highly responsive and can handle events as they occur, providing real-time capabilities.

5. **Resource Efficiency**: Reactive programming minimizes resource usage, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments and cloud-native applications.

6. **Error Handling**: Reactive programming provides a robust way to handle errors in asynchronous operations, ensuring graceful degradation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/KareemE125/Students-Reactive-Spring-Boot.git
    ```

3. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and build it using Maven.

    ```
    cd Students-Reactive-Spring-Boot
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**: Start the Spring Boot application.

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Access the API**: The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students`. You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or your web browser to interact with it.

6. **Populate the Database**: Uncomment the CommandLineRunner in the Main Class.
